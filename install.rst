.. Installation:

This code uses python3 only. I haven't even tried it with legacy python.
Deal with it.

You need to install first requirements.txt packages.
> pip install -r requirements.txt

You need then two packages from nltk:
> python
> import nltk
> nltk.download()
Type 'd'
Type 'stopwords'
Type 'd'
Type 'punkt'

Should be ok now. Enjoyyyy =)
